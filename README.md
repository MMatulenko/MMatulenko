### ♔ *Current work*: 

BTC Ai trade bot | Work in progress..

  Application of Deep Learning (SNN, CNN, LSTM) and Deep Evidential Learning (Capsa) to create an ensemble based model for stock market prediction (training data - Bitcoin daily chart with Technical Analysis, Pattern Recognition and Fundamental Analysis). Ensemble model shows:

**0.9% mean absolute percentage error(mape) on test set (20%) and 
2% mape on validation set.**
